# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a project lab given to me while in attendance at PerScholas.
We were told to follow the instructions from the Odin Project.
[Odin Project Instructions](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)
<br>
I then added buttons and gave it visuals to make this game more user friendly.

## Future Plans For Rock Paper Scissors 
During this project, I realized there was so much more I wanted to do. Which is why I built off of the basic instructions given.
<br>
<br>
A few things I would do to improve the players experience :
- Add a two player option 
- A restart button to not have to refresh the page 
- Show computers choice
